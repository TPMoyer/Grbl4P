# Measured angle between Y and X axies
# Orientations are cartesian co-ordinates as taught in USA public schools
# X positive is to the right, Y positive away, Z is positive up
# Positive Yaw   Angle is CCW viewed from above
# Positive Pitch Angle is positive above the horizontal plane
# Positive Roll  Angle is right wing up

#
# auto-correction for XY non-orthogonality
#
# Uncomment and enter a non-zero value to invoke behavior of tweeking X when Y is changed.
# The 0.106 is the measured value on Tom's first homebrew CNC.
# Units are degrees, with a positive entry reflecting uncorrected Y being east of true north.
# angleYDiffersFromXOrthogonality=0.106


# GCode Conformance Checking Enabled
# I initially messed up, and decided to add a checker section to the gcode file ingester.
# The way I messed up is to not switch back to cutting speed after manually
# patching togeather a gcode file.   Snapped a bit of by moving sideways too fast.
#
# Current Protocall:
# Current Feed rate upon first Z-Up   move is the highest accepted Z-Up   feed for the rest of the file
#
# Current Feed rate upon first Z-Down move is the highest accepted Z-Down feed for the rest of the file
#
# Current Feed rate upon first X and/or Y move, after a Z move, is highest accepted feed rate for X and/or
# Y moves (at the current Z height) for the rest of the file.
# In addition, all X and/or Y moves below the current Z height must be slower than the now current Feed rate
#
# If you do not want this protocal enforced, set GCCE=false
GCCCE=true

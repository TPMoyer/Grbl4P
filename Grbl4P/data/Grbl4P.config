# Measured angle between Y and X axies
# Orientations are cartesian co-ordinates as taught in USA public schools
# X positive is to the right, Y positive away, Z is positive up
# Positive Yaw   Angle is CCW viewed from above
# Positive Pitch Angle is positive above the horizontal plane
# Positive Roll  Angle is right wing up

# without this entry, perfect orthogonality of X and Y is assumed
#angleYDiffersFromXOrthogonality=0.106
